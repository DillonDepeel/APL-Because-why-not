# Fun-APL-Programs-
A collection of programs written in the strange world of APL, a confusing and squiggly programming language that is under appreciated!
## What Is APL?
APL is an array-oriented programming language that will change the way you think about problems and data. With a powerful, concise syntax, it lets you develop shorter programs that enable you to think more about the problem you're trying to solve than how to express it to a computer.

## Who can use APL?
Are you a Problem Solver (a domain or subject matter expert with problems to solve) or a Programmer (someone who translates those solutions into a computer-executable format)? Problem Solvers benefit from APL's ability to concisely express advanced concepts without getting bogged down with a lot of computerese syntax. Programmers benefit from APL's productivity and brevity. Shorter programs means quicker development time and less code to maintain and debug.
